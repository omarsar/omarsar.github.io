![alt txt](https://github.com/omarsar/nlp_overview/blob/master/img/nlp_overview.gif?raw=true)

\\
This project contains an overview of recent trends in deep learning based natural language processing (NLP). It covers the theoretical descriptions and implementation details behind deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and reinforcement learning, used to solve various NLP tasks and applications. The overview also contains a summary of state of the art results for NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and dialogue systems.

{% include video id="D-9ysiYKSyk" provider="youtube" %}


\\
From what's been said, machines are said to replace the human workforce in the next coming decade. In this series, I will explain to you why this may not be the case. In fact, this whole series focuses on how to take a humanistic approach in teaching machines how to properly solve tasks with high effectiveness. This involves imparting on machines ethical values and our common understanding of the world. I will explain in depth what I mean by these ideas as I go through the series.

## Past Projects

### [Secure URL Shortner Service - 2016](https://github.com/wisebits/url-shortner)

![alt txt](https://github.com/omarsar/omarsar.github.io/blob/master/images/url-shortner.png?raw=true)

\\
An URL shortner is a service that basically renders a shorter url for the one being provided (usually long). In this project, we implemented this service in a secure way that allows users to auto-generate a short URL that is secure and shareable among users with proper permission. Additionally, authors and users with the proper permission are able to access a dashboard to obtain insights into the traffic information pertaining to the URL provided. For this classroom project we applied best practices in microservices architecture and service security to build both a secure API and front-end application.
