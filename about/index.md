## Research Statement
Design, develop, and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms and models for exploring and understanding human behaviors from natural language such as *online mental disorders*, *intent*, and *emotions*. Currently, as part of my dissertation, I am building a unified framework for text-based affective computing that makes use of multimodal representations to represent different aspects of emotional communication. The main research topics include but are not limited to *emotion recognition*, *sentiment analysis*, *intent discovery*, *mental disorder detection*, *music analysis*, and *computational health*. As future work, I aim to integrate affective computing techniques into artificial intelligence (AI) and NLP technologies such as *personal assistants*, *recommendation systems*, and *conversational agents*.  This year I am part of the program committee for the [LatinX in AI Workshop @ NeurIPS](http://www.latinxinai.org/neurips-2018) and the 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics ([NAACL 2019](https://naacl2019.org/)).
