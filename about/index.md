## Education
- Information Systems and Applications (PhD Candidate) - National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan -
- Masters Degree in Information Systems and Applications (2013-2015) - National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan
- Bachelor's in Information Technology (2004-2008) - University of Belize, Belmopan, Belize

## Research Statement
Design, develop, and evaluate natural language processing and machine learning algorithms and models for exploring and understanding human behaviors from natural language such as *mental disorders*, *intent*, and *emotions*. Currently, as part of my dissertation, I am building an unified framework for text-based affective computing that makes use of multimodal representations to represent different aspects of emotional communication. The main research topics include but are not limited to *emotion recognition*, *sentiment analysis*, *intent discovery*, *mental disorder detection*, *music analysis*, and *computational health*.

## Research Interests
- Natural Language Processing
