Lately I have been participating in a lot of presentations — both at school and conferences — and one thing I have noticed is how effective visual presentations can result. Visuals reduce the amount of cognitive load that is required to better understand new content and concepts. For that reason and more, the use of photos and diagrams (charts, illustrations, flow charts) is very effective for presenting high-level presentations — even when your presentation contain unappealing content.

After designing posters for quiet some time, I have been approached by a lot of people asking me how I go about designing a research poster (tools, resources, techniques). These people range from friends, research colleagues to professors. The videos below is my attempt to help these people out.

Research posters are a lot different from the typical posters we see today. One of the differences being the seriousness required in academics, which must be properly inscribed in research posters. Additionally, the poster has to be designed in a very professional and formal manner. “There goes my shot at being creative,” you might be thinking. Frankly, you don’t have to be that serious when designing these type of posters. Ideally, you would want the poster to speak for itself and graphics is your friend.

In some cases, you still need to dedicate a huge amount of time on presenting the poster effectively especially when the content being presented is complex in nature. In such cases the visuals are there to lessen the amount of attention required of the audience. This is important as more people are becoming more used to bite-sized content. Diagrams are perfect to address these matters.

Here are two videos I recorded of myself when I was designing two research demo posters, which I used for a conference in Paris this year. Again, you can use some of the same tricks to design any type of posters. I must warn you that they are a bit lengthy so you might want to take down some notes while you view them. Enjoy and I hope it helps you out!!!
