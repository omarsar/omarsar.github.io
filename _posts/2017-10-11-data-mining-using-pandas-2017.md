This is the video recording for the Data Mining 2017 Fall first lab session. I will also post the seconds lab session here, where I will delve into advanced Text Mining topics. The lab session also has an accompanying GitHub repository, and you can find that [here](https://github.com/omarsar/data_mining_2017_fall_lab).
