Let’s not keep fooling ourselves any longer. Accept the fact that you can’t create if perfection is what you seek. And you can’t perfect if creation is what you seek. They are two little clouds — create and perfect — with two very different agendas. The sooner you realize this, the quicker you can create things, and the faster you can ship. So keep sinking or keep shipping!
