An exam for how much you don't know

The idea of testing students to quantify how much they have learned is in some sense an injured tiget in the wild. It is a tradition that has lasted for years based on the understanding that everyone learns equally. In fact, the opposite is true. We don't all learn in the same manner and in the same paste. We are wired differently and our perception vary on an exponential level. 

So why is it that we still use a traditional approach to test students? It is because there is no other way to do so. Such excuse is the easy way out for most complex matters. 

I have heard from many students that they are fed up of the old system. I have heard from Professors that they are tired of preparing exams. And the trees are tired of being cut down for unecessary purposes -- I speak for them. 

This is one of the many issues surrouding the "exam paradigm". The other aspect that bothers me is that some lecturers test how much a student doesn't know instead of testing how much the student knows. This opens a whole new discussion on the integrity of traditional examinations. We know what we know. As students, our goal is to learn not to delearn. 

So the question arises as to why are we being tested on how much we don't know without changing the grading scheme. Start us at 100 and take us close to 0. The last time I heard of this approach is the last time I saw a well-established professor get kicked out of school. But seriously, there must be alternatives to test capacity. Other options to qualify knowledge. 

Everything about an examintion is painful, and I am not sure why we have relied on it for so long. Its like a boy and his teddy bear-- unseperable bond beyond our understanding.
