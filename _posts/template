An exam for how much you don't know

The idea of testing students in order to quantify how much they have learned is in some sense an injured tiger roaming in the wild. It is just a matter of time before it succumbs to its miserable injuries. It is a tradition that has lasted for years based on the assumption that everyone learns equally. In fact, we are all aware that the exact opposite is true. We don't learn in the same manner and at the same pace. We are wired differently and our perception varies on an exponential level. 

So why is it that we still use a traditional approach to test students? Is it because there is no other way to mold students. Such excuse is the easy way out for most complex matters. 

I have heard from many students that they are fed up of the old system. I have heard from professors that they are tired of preparing exams. And the trees are tired of being cut down for unnecessary purposes, I speak for them. 

This is one of the many prevalent issues in the 'exam paradigm'. The other aspect that bothers me is that some lecturers test how much a student doesn't know instead of testing how much the student knows. This opens a whole new discussion on the integrity of traditional examinations. We know what we know and as students our goal is to learn not to 'delearn.'

So this question arises: Why are we being tested on how much we don't know without changing the grading scheme? Start us at 100 and take us close to zero. The last time I heard of this approach was the last time I saw a well-established professor get kicked out of a university. But seriously, there must be alternatives to test the student's capacity; other options to qualify knowledge. 

Everything about an examination is painful and I am not sure why we have relied on it for so long. Its like a boy and his teddy bear -- inseparable bond beyond our understanding. It must go away, but it won't do so on its own. The next generation of educators must first fill in some big shoes, and then have tenacity to bring fort change in the way examinations are prepared. My only hope is that this change comes very soon. 

### Wiligness to change
The first thing that is necessary is the willigness to change a system. If that doesn't exist there is no way forward. An open-minded soul is just begging for change. Upon this realization, then can the educators of today, regardless of generation, can team up to improve the old system. It needs to be done and they are the spring-board to accomplish such change.


### Let's us not forget that we are still humans.
AI has allowed us to understand intelligence a little better. But we must understand that these are machines, that operate on rules -- very rigid ones. They do what we tell them to do, deep down inside. They can be smart but not at the human level. From that point of view, it must be said that they can be smarter than us at knowing more, since they can be programmed to do so, but they will never have our capacity. Yes, our capacity is different and natural and it demands nurturing. We are not designed like AI, we don't remember rules well. Yes, we make them and break every so often. We are good at that. This anology helps to understand that we will never be perfect. So give us a chance. DEsign learning systems not for the robot but for the human. There must be a better way to nurture our abilities that has nothing to do with rules-based approach. Aim for developing our creativity -- we are in desperate need of such skill in today's social dynamics.

### Is it just politics?
Whenever you say school, you almost never hear the word politics, except when you are studying for it. This say a lot about academia. They remain the only true non-political entity. Is it all like that? At least that is the impression I get. Surely, there is something about policitca that goes against the nature of education and that is why it is avoided wherever possible. So why are we so political about this education system. That the rigid system doesn;t have to change because that is how it was always. I don't agree, it can change because that is the direction it needs to go. Everybody knows that. So let us keep avoiding politics and let us make a great system that our next generation can benefit from. I am hopeful that we can produce more engineers, more doctors and more astronauts -- we will need a lot of those in the way things are headed.
