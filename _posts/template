An exam to test how much you don't know


### An injured tiger
The idea of testing students in order to quantify their learning abilities or intelligence is in some sense an injured tiger roaming in the wild. It's just a matter of time before it succumbs to its miserable injuries... cold and alone. We have all seen this in our National Geographic channel, it just never leads to a positive result. For in case it's not so clear, I am referring to exams -- the worst invention since the first school was established. 

### One-time Experiment
"Testing students" is a tradition that has lasted for years based on the assumption that everyone learns equally. In fact, we are all aware that the exact opposite is true. We don't learn in the same manner and at the same pace. That's because we are wired differently and our perception varies on an exponential level.  

It required that we all sit the same exam and that the students with the highest marks are the best students out of the whole set. If you are not aware, there is only one exam given in most cases, which means that your chance to proof your intelligence is based on a one-time experiment. If this was the way we conducted our scientific experiments we would all be doomed, for sure. 

It states that we are all suppose to be able to create a mobile application after the first 4 programming sessions. That we are suppose to be great writers after the first 4 grammar sessions. That's absurd. And it's about time we start taking this issue seriously. We are discouraging students and encouraging false hopes -- that there is a better world without education.

### Pain
So why is it that we still rely on a traditional approach to test students? Is it because there is no other way to mold students into greatness. Such excuse is the easy way out for most complex matters. 

Yes, I am asking a serious question here. If I ask you to tell me what you remember about the exams you took in school, I don't expect a positive answer. Besides pain and insomnia, there is nothing much to say, really. 

I have heard from many students that they are fed up of the old system. I have heard from professors that they are tired of preparing exams. And the trees are tired of being cut down for unnecessary purposes... I speak for them. 

### Testing how much we don't know
If we want change, we must start somewhere. I start be asking this very question: Who do lecturers test how much a student doesn't know instead of testing how much the student knows. Wait, what? For in case things couldn't get any worst, the old system is coming up with new and even more disgusting ways to test the student. If testing them on how much they know doesn't know doesn't work, let's test them on how much they don't know. That's enough!

As you can see, this opens a whole new discussion on the integrity of traditional exams. We know what we know, and as students our goal is to learn not to "de-learn." I hate useless loops, and this one looks like a pretty damn good example of one. 

So the natural question arises: "Why are we being tested on how much we don't know without even changing the traditional grading scheme?" That's because we want change and we suspect that by changing the system slightly we can make a difference. Deep down we know that the whole system is the problem, not the component that make the system. 

Start us at 100 and take us close to zero. The last time I heard of this approach was the last time I saw a well-established professor get kicked out of a university. But seriously, there must be alternatives to test the student's capacity; other alternatives to qualify and quantify knowledge. 

Everything about an examination is painful and I am not sure why we have relied on it for so long. Its like a kid and his teddy bear -- inseparable bond beyond our understanding. It must go away, but it won't do so on its own. The next generation of educators must first fill in some big shoes, and then have the tenacity to bring fort change in the way examinations are prepared. My only hope is that this change comes very soon. 

### Willingness to change
The first thing that is necessary is the willingness to change a system. If that doesn't exist there is no way forward. An open-minded soul is just begging for change. Upon this realization, then can the educators of today, regardless of generation, team up to improve the old system. It needs to be done and they are our only hope to accomplish such change.


### Let's us not forget that we are still humans.
AI has allowed us to understand intelligence a little better. But we must understand that these are machines, that operate on rules -- very rigid ones. They do what we tell them to do, deep down inside. They can be smart but not at the human level. From that point of view, it must be said that they can be smarter than us at knowing more, since they can be programmed to do so, but they will never match our cognitive abilities. Yes, our capacity is different and natural and it demands nurturing. We are not designed like AI, we don't remember rules well. Yes, we make them and break every so often. We are good at that. This analogy helps to understand that we will never be perfect. So give us a chance. DEsign education systems not for robots but for the human. There must be a better way to nurture our abilities that has nothing to do with rules-based approaches. Aim for developing our creativity -- we are in desperate need of such skill in today's stagnant society.

### Is it just politics?
Whenever you say school, you almost never hear the word politics, except when you are studying for it. This says a lot about academia. They remain the only true non-political entity. Is it all like that? At least that is the impression I get. Surely, there is something about politics that goes against the nature of education and that is why it is avoided wherever possible. So why are we so political about this education system. That the rigid system doesn't have to change because that is how it was always. I don't agree, it can change because that is the direction it needs to go. Everybody knows that. So let us keep avoiding politics and let us make a great system that our next generation can benefit from. I am hopeful that we can keep producing exceptional and responsible engineers, more doctors and more astronauts -- we will need a lot of those in the way things are headed.
