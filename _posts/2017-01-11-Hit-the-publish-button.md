Everybody wants to hear a story... so tell one.

\\
Take your keboard, get a hot cup of coffee, sit down, close your internet browsers, open your notepad, and type away... for like 10 minutes, nonestop. Do this everyday and you can become a better writer and an incredible storyteller (I promise!). That is all there is to it, really.

\\
I will keep this blog post very short because I would like you to start now. It is very important, especially if you are planning to have kids one day.

\\
Relax... don't worry about grammar or typooos (see what I did there!).

\\
Oh! And there is one more thing: Hit the publish button!
