I have been playing around with Javascript web-frameworks (Facebook's [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and Googles's [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/)) lately and I am wondering how in the world Javascript went mainstream. What I am trying to say is that it's ugly as hell. When you come to think about it, its popularity actually makes a bit of sense compared to all the crazy stuff going on in the internet lately (i.e. [Snowden joins Twitter](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/29/edward-snowden-joins-twitter)).


I will leave you with this [chart](http://githut.info) below where you might be able to find a few leads that explain why this programming language packs a punch.

There are no words to describe the feeling of typing countless of paranthesis and semicolons. It feels redundant. I feel like the language itself was made so complex to scare programmers away. Nonetheless, after typing thousands of these annoying characters (semi-colons and brackets), you realize that the language is training you to be diplomatic about programming. In other words, this is not a language for lazy and undisciplined programmers.


If you want to jump into Javascript-based frameworks be prepared to pull your hair and grind your teeth a few times before you get the gist of it. Good Luck!!!
