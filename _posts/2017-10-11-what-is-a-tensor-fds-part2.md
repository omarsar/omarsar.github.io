**Synopsis:** In this video we will continue from where we left off in Part 1 of "What is a Tensor?". The main goal of this coding session is to demonstrate how to construct and use scalars, vectors, matrices, and eventually tensors of different dimensions. The tools used in this notebook are Python and Numpy. In addition, we will begin to introduce some notations, which will become useful for future programming sessions.
