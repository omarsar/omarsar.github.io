Recently, I have been experimenting with this interesting life-hack. The idea is that I want to improve the ability to produce more content than that which I consume. Here, I refer to the consumption of internet content and the production of scientific work (this could be coding in your case, or whatever your work requires).

\\
It’s easier said than done, since my mobile phone breaks all the rules of this simple life-hack, and makes it impossible. However, avoiding notifications and knowing when to ignore your phone is something particularly easy to accomplish. Heck, you can even shut it down all together if you want.

\\
Anyhow, the life-hack I will explain in the next few sentences, I must admit, is a bit of dramatic, but you will later decide if this is something worth trying for yourself.

\\
The hack goes something like this:

\\
Every morning, before starting work, I open my Chrome browser — I mean, who doesn’t? But I open it not because I want to browse the web, but because I want it to be my alert buddy. And just having it open, makes me forget that I need to open it later on— the mind tends to work like this sometimes. Every 55 minutes after the hour, the browser alerts me with something like this:

\\
“Get up, time to take a break! Or Whatever!”

\\
This functions as an alarm system. Slack has something similar, but it is not as proactive and effective as this silly alert Chrome extension called [Break Reminder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/break-reminder/phccffijboagkfgemgmbhlhloobgnmea). Talk about making good use of the browser, which is responsible for your bad browsing habits. After the 55 minutes, I take a 5 minutes break and come back exactly before the next hour starts, and I repeat this process for the entire working day — every week day. Sometimes, in that 5 minutes break, I tend to browse the internet as that is the only chance in the day that I get to do so. But as time goes by, the browser slowly looses importance and I am just able to get a lot more work done throughout the day.

\\
The benefits of this simple life-hack are as follows:

- I get a lot of work done— more than the usual
- I take breaks, which I would otherwise forget to take or take too much of
- I get all sorts of health benefits
- I defeat my bad browsing habits (I am referring to those long hours of unproductive internet browsing sessions)
- I punish my browser; I just use it for good that’s all
- And I forget all about productivity — it is just a distraction anyways

\\
There you go! A simple life-hack, that takes a few clicks, and it changes your entire working routine for good.

\\
By the way, this life-hack was inspired after I read this amazing book called: [“Peak Performance.”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450959-peak-performance) If you are into life-hacking, I strongly suggest you take a look at this book. There are tons of real world accounts about people finding different ways to achieve “peak performance”, and under different settings.
