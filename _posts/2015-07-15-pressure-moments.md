Pressure moments are the worst but they are meant to make things better. Today, I was completely put in one of these moments and for a minute I flinched but did not surrender. I held my breath for ten seconds, everything went white and suddenly, like a fish put back in its right place, I was pouncing and breathing again. This was my chance for redemption and to make things better - and that is exactly what I did. Pressure moments will always be there but it is up to you to make the most of them.
