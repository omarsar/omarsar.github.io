Paper reading is only boring when one decides that it should strictly be so. I usually doodle a new character on every paper and my mood changes instantly. By the way, the doodle is usually inspired by the content in that paper. Sometimes, a paper can be better appreciated by changing our mood. I see doodling as a form of mediating my attention and motivation for more focus reading.
