The following are a collection of links and resources I have gathered over the past few years in my involvement with Data Science. Topics range from fundamental data concepts to state of the art artificial intelligence. Have some suggestions to improve this list, please comment below or get in touch via my social handles. Good luck in your journey learning of teaching machine to think like humans. Note that these lists are not in any specific order. I plan to update them regularily and eventually provide a better curriculum to learn Data Science more efficiently. For now I will keep it simple and provide as much references to as various topics as possible. Resources include papers, code repositories, slides, my own notes, courses, syllabus, etc.
